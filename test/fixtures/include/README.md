# Test fixture protobuf include directory

- this folder contains protobuf definitions needed to complete the tests successfully
- the protos are copied from [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
   - they are only used in package-generation tests, and do not need to be kept up-to-date with any specific protobuf release
